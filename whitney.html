### General Strategy:
1. **Lead Pokémon**: Miltank or Tauros can apply immediate offensive pressure.
2. **Support Roles**: Blissey can sustain your team while spreading status effects.
3. **Sweepers**: Tauros, Lopunny, and Pidgeot serve as heavy hitters with great speed.
4. **Annoyance**: Utilize moves like Milk Drink and Toxic to frustrate opponents.
5. **Team Buffs**: If doubles, consider using Clefable with **Follow Me** to redirect attacks.

This team mirrors Whitney’s tendency to pressure opponents with strong Normal-type moves and some healing thrown in to prolong fights.
